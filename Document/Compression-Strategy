=> Calendar Compression Strategy

1. Why Compression?

Calendars often contain:
i) Repeated time blocks
ii) Overlapping events
iii) Redundant intervals
This increases:
i) Storage cost
ii) Search time
iii) Retrieval latency


2. Compression Methods:

a) Interval Merging:
If:
10:00–11:00
10:30–01:00
Merge into:
10:00–01:00

b) Bitmap Encoding (Optional Future Enhancement):
Each day:
3 AM–7 PM = 960 minutes
Represent availability as 960-length binary vector.

c) Weekly Pattern Summarization:
Identify:
i) Frequent busy hours
ii) Repeated meeting patterns
Store summary embedding instead of raw logs.


3. Benefits:

i) Reduced memory usage
ii) Faster retrieval
iii) Lower FAISS index size
iv) Improved scheduling speed
